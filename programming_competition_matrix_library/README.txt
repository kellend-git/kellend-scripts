A simple matrix library for use at a programming competition, where it must be manually typed in. Certainly not very well optimized, but much simpler than typing a full library. I included sanity checks at the top of several functions that could be skipped at  the competition.

Inversion uses just the standard method, no QR or LU, but is still O(n^3) so should be good enuogh if necessary at a competition.

MartixTest.java tests the main features.
