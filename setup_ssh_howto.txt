This isn't a script - just a reminder for the commands to set up ssh-keys

1) On the local machine: ssh-keygen -t dsa
  Should probably have a passphrase, can set up ssh-agent so you don't have to
   type this in every time
  Save in the default location
2) scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub <hostmachine>:
3) Log into the host machine: ssh <hostmachine>
4) cat id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
5) rm id_dsa.pub
  # For clean up
  
# Make sure your authorized_keys is not group readable!
# I have seen many CSE students with this exposed!
