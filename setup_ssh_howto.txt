This isn't a script - just a reminder for the commands to set up ssh-keys

1) On the local machine: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
  Should probably have a passphrase, can set up ssh-agent so you don't have to
   type this in every time
  Save in the default location
2) scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <hostmachine>:
3) Log into the host machine: ssh <hostmachine>
4) cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
5) rm id_rsa.pub # For clean up
  
# Make sure your authorized_keys is not group/other writeable!
# I have seen many CSE students with this exposed!

# If you overrode the existing identity on the local machine
# then you will have to execute ssh-add to update to the new
# identity.
